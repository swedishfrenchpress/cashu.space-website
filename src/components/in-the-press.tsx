/**
 * In the press — the closing band of press mentions, modeled on the Griffin
 * "stories" layout: a 3-up row of cards, each a grayscale story photo over a
 * headline with the publication's wordmark beneath. The grayscale imagery
 * and the flattened marks read as one monochrome surface on either ground.
 *
 * Three cards show at desktop width; a prev/next pager (top-right, where
 * a "view all" link would sit) scrolls the snap-track to reach the rest.
 * Editorial photography reports rather than depicts, so it sits outside
 * the Depicted-World Exception: photos are desaturated by CSS to hold the
 * No-Colour Rule, and publication wordmarks are flattened to Ink
 * (--press-mark in globals.css).
 *
 * The ground is Paper. It was `bg-black text-white` on the reasoning that it
 * "sits on Ink like the reference-implementations section it follows" — and
 * that section stopped sitting on Ink on 2026-08-16, when a whole band stuck
 * dark was rejected for reading as a bug rather than a decision. This band was
 * the same defect one section later: the page ran white document, hard black
 * slab, black footer, and the `rgba(255,255,255,0.08)` top hairline it used to
 * separate itself from the black section above had nothing left to do. It is
 * not on the fixed-value list in globals.css, and DESIGN.md §5 reserves the
 * Twilight Stack for the closing CTA and footer, so the dark run starts at the
 * footer and not here.

   * DRAG THE RAIL (2026-08-21). The press rail is the one component on the site

   *
   * THIS IS ADDITIVE, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. The track stays a real scroll
   * container — touch scrolling, trackpad, keyboard, and the pager all keep
   * working untouched, and none of them go through this code. Motion's `drag`
   * was the obvious reach and is deliberately NOT used: it wants a transform-
   * driven rail, and converting to one would trade native touch and keyboard
   * scrolling for a mouse affordance. So this drives `scrollLeft` directly and
   * only ever attaches to a fine pointer.
   *
   * SNAP IS SUSPENDED FOR THE LENGTH OF THE DRAG. With `scroll-snap-type: x
   * mandatory` the browser re-snaps on every scrollLeft write, so dragging
   * against it feels like pulling something over a ratchet. It is restored the
   * moment the glide lands — and the glide lands ON a snap point, so restoring
   * it is a no-op rather than a correction the reader can see. That is the same
   * reasoning `step()` states below for using scrollTo over scrollBy.
